## What I am Actively Hyped About:
Right now, a lot of my focus is going into a collaborative gaming project I am working on currently known as Apocalypse Farm (not our actual final name). This project is being built within Unity and is the marriage of few of my favorite gaming mechanics and elements, including farming, community building, survival, world exploration, and dungeon crawling. The setting of the game starts deep in a Haven, which is a sanctuary for surviving humans and the future of mankind. This Haven is run by an artificial intelligence that is both a foster guardian and teacher. As the player soon learns, the outside world holds more secrets than they could imagine within the confines of their isolated sanctuary. Venturing to the outside world opens up new possibilities and invites possibility of rebuilding the world from the shattered ruins of the past.
